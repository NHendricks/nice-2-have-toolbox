commander:
- refactor commander.ts (very expensive action !!!)
### Next Steps to Complete Full Refactoring

To complete the refactoring and achieve the 72% size reduction:

1. __Integrate NavigationUtils__ (~120 lines saved)

   - Replace `getParentPath()` with `NavigationUtils.getParentPath()`
   - Replace `isImageFile()` with `NavigationUtils.isImageFile()`
   - Replace `viewNextImage()`/`viewPreviousImage()` with utility methods

2. __Integrate PaneManager__ (~50 lines saved)

   - Replace `getActivePane()`, `getInactivePane()`, `updateActivePane()`
   - Initialize paneManager in connectedCallback()

3. __Extract KeyboardHandler__ (~300 lines saved)

   - Move `handleGlobalKeydown()` to separate handler class
   - Use command pattern for key mappings

4. __Extract FileOperationHandlers__ (~200 lines saved)

   - Move F-key handlers to separate module
   - Extract execute methods (zip, operation, delete, etc.)

__Estimated final size:__ 400-500 lines (from 1800 = 72% reduction)
