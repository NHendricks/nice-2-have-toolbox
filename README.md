# nice2have-toolbox (https://www.nice2havetoolbox.de/)

This **Nice2Have Toolbox** is a modular Electron-based utility application with an extensible command-line backend and interactive UI.

## install

see https://github.com/NHendricks/nh-toolbox/releases

For **Windows** just unzip and start it.

For **Linux** (tested on Ubuntu) call **sudo install.sh** in terminal to install it.

The binaries are unsigned. So on **Mac** you might get an error message when you start it. Then go to Mac settings - security and allow nh-toolbox to be executed.
In the Terminal call **xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine nh-toolbox.app** in terminal if it still doesnt want to start. Macs are getting more weird with every update ... . Im sorry but i dont want to pay for an apple ID.

**Changelog** see https://github.com/NHendricks/nh-toolbox/blob/main/version/changelog.md

## Motivation

When i changed from Windows to Mac i needed to switch back to Windows because my Total Commander
was not available :-) And i couldnt get used to the keyboard shortcuts.

Additionaly i built a lot of cmdline tools for my private use in the past and i wanted to have one place to manage and run them.

So i thought why not build one app with many apps inside. Usable on all platforms. Starting with the nh-commander lets see how it grows. Feel free to contribute !

## Overview

This is a desktop application that provides a flexible framework for running various utility commands through both a CLI interface and a modern web-based UI. Built with TypeScript, Electron, and Lit Elements, it offers a clean architecture for adding new tools and commands.

## Features

- 🎯 **Extensible Command System** - Easy-to-add commands with a plugin-like architecture
- 🖥️ **Dual Interface** - Use commands via CLI or interactive UI
- ⚡ **IPC Communication** - Seamless bridge between Electron and backend
- 📦 **Production Ready** - Build standalone executables
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Responsive interface built with Lit Elements
- 📝 **TypeScript** - Fully typed codebase

```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run buildWindowsApp
```

The executable will be created in the `build-output` directory.
